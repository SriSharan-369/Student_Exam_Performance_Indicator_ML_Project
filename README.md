## Student Exam Performance Indicator
This project explores how various factors such as Gender, Ethnicity, Parental Level of Education, Lunch Type, and Test Preparation Course influence students' performance in exams. By analyzing these variables, we aim to gain insights that could help educators and policymakers improve educational outcomes.

Project Objective
The main goal of this project is to:

Understand the relationship between student demographics and their academic performance.

Identify which factors most significantly impact exam scores.

Build predictive models that can estimate exam scores based on input variables.

Features
📊 Interactive Data Analysis Perform in-depth analysis of student exam scores across various demographic and socioeconomic factors.

🧹 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and normalizes data for model training.

📈 Visual Insights Generate clear and compelling charts using Matplotlib and Seaborn to explore trends and patterns in the data.

🧠 Machine Learning Models Build and evaluate predictive models to estimate exam scores based on input features.

🔍 Feature Importance Analysis Identify which features (e.g., parental education, test preparation) have the greatest influence on performance.

⚙️ Modular and Scalable Code Well-organized code structure with reusable functions for easy expansion or adaptation.

🌐 Live Web App Access the analysis or predictions via a user-friendly web interface (using Streamlit ).
